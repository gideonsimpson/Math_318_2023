title: "Unbiasedness of Sample Variance"

This example script verifies that, because the sample variance is computed using

$$
\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{i=1}^N(x_i - \bar{x})^2
$$

where the important property is that it is divided by $N-1$ and not $N$, we obtain an unbiased estimate of the variance.

```{r}
set.seed(100)
# Individual sample size
N <- 10
# Number of samples of size N to collect
M <- 10^6
# preallocate the array where we will store estimates of sigma2
sigma2_vals <- vector(length = M)
# Repeatedly generate samples of M elements and estimate the
# variance, sigma2
for (j in 1:M){
  xdata <- rnorm(N)
  sigma2_vals[j] <- var(xdata)
}
# print the mean of the computed sample variances
mean(sigma2_vals)
var(sigma2_vals)
```

```{r}
hist(sigma2_vals)
```
