Show the use of Q-Q plots to compare distributions of random variables.

```{r}
set.seed(100)
# generate synthetic data
u <- runif(10^3)
v <- runif(10^3, min=10,max=25)
w <- runif(10^3)
x <- rnorm(10^4)
y <- rnorm(10^4, mean=10,sd=2)
# generate plots. these are saved as png's for efficiency

qqplot(u,v,main = "Q-Q Plot for Two Distinct Uniform Data Sets")

qqplot(u,w,main = "Q-Q Plot for Two Uniform Data Sets")

qqnorm(u, main = "Q-Q Plot for a Uniform Data Set against N(0,1)")

qqplot(x,y,main = "Q-Q Plot for Two Distinct Normal Data Sets")

qqnorm(y, main = "Q-Q Plot for a Normal Data Set against N(0,1)")

qqline(y)

```
